                    This vlog-style video serves as a demonstration of my video editing and modification skills. Utilizing techniques such as green screening, masking, motion tracking (both automatic and manual), stabilization, and custom motion graphics, the video showcases a range of abilities. Additionally, extra attention was given to audio editing to enhance overall quality.
                    
                    I enjoy putting humor in my works so i couldn't pass up the chance to add a whole bunch of green screen creatures when we couldn't find any animals on the hike.
                    Over all this was a very inclusive learning experience, I had to solve a lot of issues to make the video the way it is with limited resources.
