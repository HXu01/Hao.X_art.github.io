                    This is glitch art created by corrupting image text file then broght to Photoshop for post process effects.
                    The original artwork consisted of two of my digital paintings: one depicting a demon and the other a seraph.
                    Experimenting with colors in this piece was particularly enjoyable, as the glitching process transformed the images in unexpected ways. The addition of post-processing effects added to the visual experience. This was one of the first times I have ever messed with the code of an image,
                    it was an interesting learning process to see how the code interacted with the imagry.
